Redback Configuration

  <<NOTE>>: This has changed dramatically and may not be correct.

  Configuration in Redback is governed by a plexus configuration setup making
use of properties files.  Below is a listing of all of the available configuration options along with default values and notes on what they are where applicable.
  
* Configuration File Locations

  Configuration file location can depend on the application that is embedding Redback.  Since Redback is currently built up off of Plexus, it would be ideal to check out the application.xml of the relevant application and look for an entry similar to the following.

--------------------------------------------

   <component>
      <role>org.codehaus.plexus.redback.configuration.UserConfiguration</role>
      <implementation>org.codehaus.plexus.redback.configuration.UserConfiguration</implementation>
      <configuration>
        <configs>
          <config>${user.home}/.m2/security.properties</config>
          <config>${user.home}/.m2/security-example.properties</config>
        </configs>
      </configuration>
    </component>

--------------------------------------------

* Configuration Options

** Application Configuration

  * application.timestamp=EEE d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z

  * application.url=http://myurl.mycompany.com
  
    * Set the application base URL. The default is to derive it from the HTTP request

** JDBC Setup

  By default Redback uses Apache Derby for persistence of user and role
information.  This can be configured with the following options.

  * jdbc.driver.name=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver

  * jdbc.url=jdbc:derby:${plexus.home}/database;create=true

  * jdbc.username=sa

  * jdbc.password=

  []

  By default Redback uses Apache Derby for persistence of user and role information.  This can be configured with the following options.

  <<Note:>> If you are using MySQL as your database, the database will not be populated if the encoding is initially set to UTF-8. As a workaround, set the database to UTF-8 encoding after it has been populated. See {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/REDBACK-267} REDBACK-267}} for more details.



** Email Settings

  * email.jndiSessionName=java:comp/env/mail/Session
  
  * email.smtp.host=localhost

  * email.smtp.port=25

  * email.smtp.ssl.enabled=false

  * email.smtp.tls.enabled=false
 
  * email.smtp.username=

  * email.smtp.password=

  * email.from.address=${user.name}@localhost
  
    * All emails sent by the system will be from the following address

  * email.from.name=Unconfigured Username

  * email.validation.required=true

    * If all email addresses (from new user registration) require an account validation email. 

  * email.validation.timeout=2880

    * Timeout (in minutes) for the key generated for an email validation to remain valid.

    * 2880 minutes = 48 hours

  * email.validation.subject=Welcome

  * email.feedback.path=/feedback.action

    * Get the Feedback to use for any outgoing emails.

    * Feedback path starts with a "/" it is appended to the end of the value provided in application.url.  This value can be in the format/syntax of "/feedback.action" or even "mailto:feedback@application.com"
 


** Auto Login Settings

  * security.rememberme.enabled=true

  * security.rememberme.timeout=525600

    * Timeout in minutes ( 525600 minutes = 1 year )

  * security.signon.timeout=30

    * Single Sign On
    
    * Timeout is in minutes

** Default Username Values

  * redback.default.admin=admin

    * name for the admin user, by default this is 'admin' and can not easily be changed after the fact at this point.  However any number of people may be assigned full administrator roles.

  * redback.default.guest=guest

    * name of the guest user



** Security Policies

  * security.policy.password.encoder=

  * security.policy.password.previous.count=6

  * security.policy.password.expiration.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.expiration.days=90

  * security.policy.password.expiration.notify.days=10

  * security.policy.allowed.login.attempt=10

  * security.policy.strict.enforcement.enabled=true
  
    * turn off the perclick enforcement of various security policies, slightly more heavyweight since it will ensure that the User object on each click is up to date

  * security.policy.strict.force.password.change.enabled=true

    * forces the user to change their password immediately should their account be flagged for a password change.

  * security.policy.unlockable.accounts

    * can be specified multiple times to ensure that password policies never lock the specified account(s) (eg. security.policy.unlockable.accounts=guest )

** Password Rules

  * security.policy.password.rule.alphanumeric.enabled=false

  * security.policy.password.rule.alphacount.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.rule.alphacount.minimum=1

  * security.policy.password.rule.characterlength.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.rule.characterlength.minimum=1

  * security.policy.password.rule.characterlength.maximum=24

  * security.policy.password.rule.musthave.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.rule.numericalcount.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.rule.numericalcount.minimum=1

  * security.policy.password.rule.reuse.enabled=true

  * security.policy.password.rule.nowhitespace.enabled=true

** LDAP settings

  Ldap can be used as a readonly user manager, however the role assignment is still managed entirely within the given database store.  This should be fixed in the future sometime but likely not before ldap is switched over as the default user and role store entirely.

  * ldap.user.store.enabled=false

  * ldap.bind.authenticator.enabled=false

*** ldap options for configuration via properties file

  * ldap.config.hostname=

  * ldap.config.port=

  * ldap.config.base.dn=

  * ldap.config.context.factory=

  * ldap.config.bind.dn=

  * ldap.config.password=
 
  * ldap.config.authentication.method=

** User Manager Implementation to use

  * user.manager.impl=cached
  
    * valid values for realistic usage are 'cached' and then further configuring the cached instance to use another underlying user manager like ldap or the jdo one which is used by default.  Placing 'ldap' here will check with the ldap system for a fair amount of checks and would likely be a performance issue
