Redback Rest Support

  Prior to 1.3 version some redback services are available trough rest request.

  We use jaxrs annotations and authz/karma are verified through cxf interceptors.

* Maven Module

  You must add the following maven dependency

+--------------------------------------+

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.redback</groupId>
      <artifactId>redback-rest-services</artifactId>
      <version>${redbackVersion}</version>
    </dependency>

+--------------------------------------+


* CXF setup

  The spring file is in the redback-rest-services module.
  You must add META-INF/spring-context.xml in your spring configuration.

  And add cxf servlet in your web.xml :

+--------------------------------------+

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.CXFServlet</servlet-class>
      <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/services/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

+--------------------------------------+

* CXF interceptors

  Rest services are declared as it in the cxf configuration :

+--------------------------------------+

  <jaxrs:server id="redbackServices" address="/redbackServices">
    <jaxrs:providers>
      <ref bean="authenticationInterceptor#rest"/>
      <ref bean="permissionInterceptor#rest"/>
    </jaxrs:providers>
	  <jaxrs:serviceBeans>
      <ref bean="userService#rest"/>
      ... more coming ...
    </jaxrs:serviceBeans>
   </jaxrs:server>

+--------------------------------------+

** AuthenticationInterceptor

  This interceptor is basic on HTTP BASIC authz with using HttpBasicAuthentication spring component.

** PermissionInterceptor

  This inceptor will use a new created annotation named @RedbackAuthorization which supports attributes : permission, resource and noRestriction.

   You can use it :

+--------------------------------------+

   @RedbackAuthorization( permission = "user-management-user-create" )
   public Boolean deleteUser( @PathParam( "userName" ) String username )
+--------------------------------------+

   The interceptor will basically check if the user has the required permission.

   <<Note all exposed services must be marked with this annotation. If not forbidden http response will be returned.>>

   If the service doesn't need special permission you must do :

+--------------------------------------+

   @RedbackAuthorization(noRestriction = true)
   public Boolean ping()

+--------------------------------------+

* Client Usage

  Dependencies to add in order to use those REST Services

      <groupId>org.codehaus.redback</groupId>
      <artifactId>redback-rest-api</artifactId>
